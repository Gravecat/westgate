  name: The Forge-City of Caledonia
  version: 4

ARROW_PARK:
  desc: "The atmosphere is thick and heavy, tall chimney stacks looming ominously in the sky. Here, surrounded by the stone walls, rests a small natural
    sanctuary. The grass is thick and green underfoot, and tall trees block out a little of the surrounding buildings, leaves rustling softly. Covering almost a
    quarter of the park is a large pool, edged in natural rock and varying in depth. To the south stand thick pines, hidden behind which is a weathered brick
    platform."

ARROW_PARK_S:
  desc: "A weathered brick platform is settled firmly within the cluster of evergreens, grass and wildflowers creeping through cracks in the old stone. The
    trees here are dense and deep enough that the city seems it might be miles away, forgiving the encroaching plumes of smoke breaching the treetops. A large,
    rusted iron ring in the middle of the brick platform marks a passage into the ground."

ARROW_TRENCH:
  desc: "Rough stone slopes up about eight feet to the ceiling, the floor clean. Seems you're on one end of a long trench, close to the surface end, the other
    vanished into darkness. The ceiling ends and one can probably climb up the sloped sides to the forest floor, dark evergreens towering well above you. Barely
    visible in the gloom, a heavy metal gate leads southwest."

ARROW_TRENCH_CENTRAL:
  desc: "You find yourself at a crossroads of a sort, a rough stone tunnel of chipped yet clean stone, a trench with angled sides leading off into the gloom to
    both the east and west. To the southeast you see a crude hole has been torn in the slope, leading into what looks like a dry dirt tunnel, while a heavy
    metal grate mounted in an opening to the north leads into further darkness, along with the distant sound of running water."

ARROW_TRENCH_COLLAPSED:
  desc: "The rough stone trench comes to a rather abrupt end here, its sloping walls still reaching to the tall stone ceiling, but the passage east is
    completely blocked by a cave-in, huge chunks of rubble packed together with dirt completely sealing off anything that may have existed to the east."

BERESTALL_KINGS:
  desc: "Two roads collide without a sound, a battered street marker reading 'Berestall Street' and 'King's Road'. The sky is obscured by a tall building to the
    southeast, looming ominously over this intersection. More residential buildings make up these city walls, with a single corner shop nestled between
    dilapidated structures, the sign outside proclaiming it to be 'The Hunter's Mark'. At the northeast corner stands another tall building, a worn and creaking
    sign indicating it to be 'The Red Dragon Inn'."

BERESTALL_STREET:
  desc: "Tall buildings reflect the light along the northern edge of this street. These are primarily residential buildings, though a few shops do exist; some
    of them are even still in business. Directly across from the entrance to the park two buildings in particular stand out: signs mark them as 'Yetu's
    Supplies' and 'The Golden Cauldron'. Through a gap in a low wall to the south lies the main central park, trees rising toward the sky, yet still dwarfed by
    the surrounding buildings, while the street stretches east and west."

BERESTALL_STREET_2:
  desc: "The shadows of the park's trees lay across the street, drawing stripes down a north-south road, apparently labeled 'Crosswood Alley' by a rusted street
    corner sign. It intersects here with Berestall. The surrounding buildings seem less imposing, as a quarter of the nearest area is the central park and the
    southwest quadrant is taken up by the Central Underground station. A wide set of stairs leads down into the subway, a weatherbeaten and faded sign
    proclaiming the name stretched over the stairs."

COLLAPSED_CITY_TUNNEL:
  desc: "The dirt tunnels leading from the west and north appear to have collapsed long ago here, the roof open to the city above with some rubble and rusted,
    wrecked old debris from above strewn around, covered in grime and thick layers of moss and vines. The walls partly consist of dirt, partly of the lower
    levels and foundations of the ancient brick and stone buildings which tower high above. Makeshift entrances into some of the buildings are visible to the
    east and southeast."

CROSSWOOD_ALLEY:
  desc: "Half in shadow from the park's trees, Crosswood Alley runs at the park's western edge. A low stone wall runs along the eastern side of the street,
    breaking once in a path that opens into the park. To the other side are a row of tall buildings and various shops, though most are closed."

FETID_WARRENS:
  desc: "The west branch of this tunnel ends in a slightly more spacious room, largely unremarkable save for a few sizeable holes dug in the rough earth, from
    which an atrocious stench emerges. It's not hard to imagine what this room's purpose is, and why further investigation would be unwise."

FLOODED_UNDERCITY:
  desc: "What may have once been the foundations of one of the sprawling city buildings above is now a huge flooded cave, dimly lit from small openings in the
    rotting ceiling above, huge vine-covered pillars holding the stone sky aloft. Debris and rotting wood lays strewn around this cavern, and fetid greenish
    water sprawls out as far as the eye can see to the east, disappearing into a gloomy underground lake."

KINGS_ROAD_1:
  desc: "A line of buildings stand before you to the east, rather typical and run in various states of disrepair, as everything seems to show its age in the
    city. Across the road runs a low wall, opening to the park, the tops of the trees reaching over the wall's peak. Of the nearby buildings, most noteworthy is
    a decrepit two-storey building that holds a bookstore, judging by the piles of dusty tomes visible through the window. The bookstore sits directly across
    from the park."

SEWER_KINGS:
  desc: "The sewer curves here, the stagnant stream of rainwater leading off into gloom to the west and northeast, flanked by mossy red brick walkways and
    rusted iron handrails. It's hard to see here, though the small drainage grates in the ceiling allow some light from the city above to trickle down into the
    oppressive gloom. Mounted in the brick wall to the south is a heavy, tarnished metal grate, which appears to lead into a sloped tunnel."

SKITTERING_TUNNEL:
  desc: "Curving around to the west and south, this dirt tunnel has been carved roughly from the dry earth, barely high enough for you to be able to stand
    without hunching under dry roots or rusted pieces of metal jutting from the ceiling. You can barely see your way thanks to half-buried, dimly-glowing
    mushrooms in the ground, which rather more alarmingly reveal hundreds of insects skittering around the uneven soil."

SUBTERRANEAN_GRAVEYARD:
  desc: "This series of dirt-hewn tunnels opens up into a larger chamber, the ceiling high enough that you could barely touch it if you jumped. Glowing
    mushrooms in the loamy soil illuminate the area in an unearthly green haze, revealing a number of open graves - some occupied, some not - as well as more
    dirt mounds with crudely-fashioned headstones made from pieces of debris or rusting metal signs. Several tunnels lead off into the gloom."

WRETCHED_ENCAMPMENT:
  desc: "This was probably once the basement of one of the buildings towering above, but it's now little more than a ruined scrapyard. Ancient brick walls are
    filthy and damaged, the ceiling above is torn open to reveal rusted pipes, and the floor is strewn with all manner of debris covering almost every surface,
    a few torn old sheets here and there, empty bottles, rotting crates, and rusted old metal boxes. The exits are mostly blocked by debris, leaving only a
    rusted old door to the west."

WRETCHED_TUNNEL:
  desc: "This tunnel has been carved roughly out of the dry, dead earth, a few half-buried glowing mushrooms providing enough illumination to find your way
    along the uneven ground. The tunnel mostly heads east-west, with a fetid breeze blowing through from the western end, though an opening in the wall leads
    into a larger chamber to the north."
