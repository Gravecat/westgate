  name: The Forge-City of Westgate
  version: 2

ARROW_PARK:
  coords: [ 0, 0, 0 ]
  desc: >
     The atmosphere is thick and heavy, tall chimney stacks looming ominously in the sky. Here, surrounded by the stone walls, rests a small natural sanctuary.
     The grass is thick and green underfoot, and tall trees block out a little of the surrounding buildings, leaves rustling softly. Covering almost a quarter
     of the park is a large pool, edged in natural rock and varying in depth. To the south stand thick pines, hidden behind which is a weathered brick platform.

    A weathered brick platform is settled firmly within the cluster of evergreens, grass and wildflowers creeping through cracks in the old stone. The trees
    here are dense and deep enough that the city seems it might be miles away, forgiving the encroaching plumes of smoke breaching the treetops. A large,
    rusted iron ring in the middle of the brick platform marks a passage into the ground.

  desc: >
    Rough stone slopes up about eight feet to the ceiling, the floor clean. Seems you're on one end of a long trench, close to the surface end, the other
    vanished into darkness. The ceiling ends and one can probably climb up the sloped sides to the forest floor, dark evergreens towering well above you. Barely
    visible in the gloom, a heavy metal gate leads southwest.
